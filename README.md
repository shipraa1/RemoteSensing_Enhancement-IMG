# RemoteSensing_Enhancement-IMG
This project focuses on enhancing the contrast and sharpness of images using OpenCV and various image processing techniques, including global contrast enhancement with a sigmoid function and adjustments to Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients.

## Features

- **Global Contrast Enhancement:** Improves the image contrast using a sigmoid function applied to the histogram of the grayscale image.
- **DCT Adjustment:** Enhances the image sharpness by manipulating the DCT coefficients of the luminance channel in the YUV color space.
- **Interactive UI:** Allows users to upload an image and adjust enhancement parameters using interactive sliders.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV:** Library for computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** Library for plotting images.
- **IPyWidgets:** Library for creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks.
